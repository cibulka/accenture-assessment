## What is this?

This is the brief:

> The goal of this task is to evaluate your approach to expanding and innovating an existing design system to accommodate multiple front-end platforms: mobile, desktop, in-car HMI, smart home devices, and wearables. You will describe your strategy for adapting the current component library to ensure consistency, usability, and innovation across all platforms.

Here is my presentation: [accenture.cibulka.codes](https://accenture.cibulka.codes).

It was a fun task! Within the limited two-day timeframe, I prioritized:

- **Understanding the brief**: Thoroughly analyzing the project requirements.
- **Setting up the prototype**: Creating a library for UI system, including Storybook environment and unit tests. It is installed as one of the dependencies of this presentation.
- **Developing a strategy**: Outlining my approaches for building a scalable and sustainable component system.

## Component library (proof of concept)

Check out the demo at [accenture-ui.cibulka.codes](https://accenture-ui.cibulka.codes) as well as the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cibulka/accenture-assessment-components) with technical documentation.
